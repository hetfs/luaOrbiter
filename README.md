# 🌌 luaOrbiter

**luaOrbiter** delivers a project-based, open-source [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) learning journey from **absolute beginner** to **expert**. The course emphasizes AI scripting, embedded systems, game development, and developer tools.

Powered by the [luaDev](https://github.com/hetfs/luaDev) engine and built on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), this platform offers modular, hands-on learning mirroring real-world Lua usage.

## 📖 What you'll learn

- ✅ Lua fundamentals: syntax, functions, tables, flow control
- 🧠 Intermediate: coroutines, modules, metatables
- 🚀 Advanced: LuaJIT, Foreign Function Interface (FFI), C integration, async design
- 🎮 Game scripting: behavior trees, AI NPCs, event systems
- 🔌 Embedded scripting: Redis, ESP32, IoT control
- 🤖 AI-powered workflows: Python + Lua orchestration
- 🛠 Tooling: Build systems, linters, DSLs, plugins
