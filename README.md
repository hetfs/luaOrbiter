# 🌌 luaOrbiter

**luaOrbiter** is a project-based, open-source Lua learning course designed to take you from **absolute beginner** to **expert**, with a strong focus on AI scripting, embedded systems, game development, and developer tools.

Built on top of the [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) platform and powered by the [luaDev](https://github.com/hetfs/luaDev) engine, it delivers a modular, hands-on experience that mirrors real-world Lua usage in production environments.

---

## 📖 What You'll Learn

- ✅ Lua fundamentals: syntax, functions, tables, flow control
- 🧠 Intermediate: coroutines, modules, metatables
- 🚀 Advanced: LuaJIT, FFI, C integration, async design
- 🎮 Game scripting: behavior trees, AI NPCs, event systems
- 🔌 Embedded scripting: Redis, ESP32, IoT control
- 🤖 AI-powered workflows: Python + Lua orchestration
- 🛠 Tooling: Build systems, linters, DSLs, plugins

All driven by real-world projects like:

- Text-based games
- Inventory systems
- Lua-backed AI bots
- IoT data pipelines
- Game modding tools

---

## 🛠 Built with [luaDev](https://github.com/hetfs/luaDev)

`luaDev` is a powerful Lua/LuaJIT build system that powers the backend of this learning platform. It automates cross-platform builds, version-aware CMake scaffolding, and structured logging.

If you're writing Lua in native environments, you should definitely check it out!
