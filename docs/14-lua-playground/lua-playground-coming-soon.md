# 🧪 Lua Playground is Coming Soon!

We’re excited to announce that the **interactive Lua Playground** is coming to `luaOrbiter` — a built-in environment to write, run, and experiment with Lua **directly in your browser**.

---

## 🌟 What’s the Lua Playground?

The new **Lua Playground** will bring a smooth, instant coding experience to every lesson and tutorial on this site.

Powered by [**Fengari**](https://fengari.io/), a Lua 5.3 engine compiled to WebAssembly, the playground will allow you to:

✅ Write Lua code in the browser  
✅ See results instantly with zero setup  
✅ Follow lessons and practice side-by-side  
✅ Use any device — desktop, tablet, or mobile  

---

## 🚀 Key Features

## ✅ In-Browser Execution

No install? No problem. You’ll run Lua **100% client-side**, right inside the lesson pages.

## 🎓 Beginner-Friendly

Every Lua code block will offer a **“Try It”** button, so you can test what you’re learning as you go.

## 🧰 Built for Education

- Integrated with our lessons
- Safe, sandboxed, and distraction-free
- Great for exercises, demos, and live challenges

---

## 🔍 How Does It Work?

The playground is powered by:

- **Fengari**: WebAssembly Lua VM (Lua 5.3)
- **React**: For rendering playground components
- **Docusaurus**: Embedded via MDX for seamless learning

Example experience:

```lua
print("Hello from luaOrbiter!")
print(_VERSION)
````

✅ Output:

```
Hello from luaOrbiter!
Lua 5.3
```

## 🗓️ Coming Soon...

We’re putting the final touches on:

* [x] React-based Lua runner component
* [x] Output window with live result display
* [ ] Editable Lua code blocks
* [ ] `/playground` page for full scripts
* [ ] Live challenge exercises for beginners

The playground will roll out **with the next site update**. 🎉
