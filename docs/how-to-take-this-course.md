# 🧭 How to Take This Course

Welcome to **luaOrbiter** — your mission-based Lua learning journey designed for developers, creators, and tinkerers alike. Whether you're just getting started or aiming to master embedded scripting, this guide shows you how to get the most out of this course.

---

## 🚀 Step 1: Set Up Your Learning Environment

### 🖥️ Requirements

- A modern browser (for reading lessons)
- A code editor like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Optionally: Lua installed locally via [`luaDev`](https://github.com/hetfs/luaDev) (advanced)

```bash 
git clone https://github.com/hetfs/luaOrbiter.git
cd luaOrbiter
npm install
npm run start
```

Access the course locally at: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/)

## 📚 Step 2: Follow the Skill Path

luaOrbiter is structured into 5 major progression levels. You can go in order or jump ahead if you already know the basics.

| Level | What You’ll Learn | Suggested Duration |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 👶 Beginner | Lua syntax, tables, conditionals, functions | 2–4 weeks |
| 👨‍💻 Intermediate | Modules, metatables, coroutines, JSON | 8–12 weeks |
| 👨‍🏫 Advanced | LuaJIT, C bindings, profiling, FFI | 4–6 months |
| 🧠 Expert | DSLs, VM internals, sandboxing, transpilers | 1–2 years |
| 💼 Professional | Real-world AI, tools, embedded systems | Career-aligned |

Each level includes hands-on projects like:

- ✅ Text-based games
  
- ✅ AI decision-making bots
  
- ✅ Lua-powered API clients
  
- ✅ Edge computing controllers
  
- ✅ Redis & LuaJIT integrations
  

---

## 🎯 Step 3: Pick a Track (Optional)

Once you're comfortable with the basics, you can **specialize** based on your interests:

| Track | Focus Areas |
| --- | --- |
| 🎮 Game Dev | NPC scripting, UI mods, game engines (Roblox, Love2D) |
| 🔌 Embedded | IoT scripting, firmware automation, Lua on ESP32 |
| 🤖 AI & Automation | Lua as a control layer for ML & LLM pipelines |
| 🛠 Dev Tools | Plugins, linters, code editors, transpilers |

Track-specific mini-lessons and projects are labeled throughout the course.

---

## 🧪 Step 4: Build Projects

Every module includes real-world mini-projects. Don't skip them — they’re where the magic happens.

Start with simple exercises:

```lua
-- Rock-paper-scissors logic
choices = {"rock", "paper", "scissors"}
print("You chose: " .. choices[math.random(1,3)])
```

Then level up to:

- Building a full dialogue engine
  
- Writing Lua API clients
  
- Scripting AI NPCs
  
- Integrating with C libraries
  
- Creating Lua-powered developer tools
  

---

## 🤝 Step 5: Contribute & Collaborate

You don’t have to learn alone.

- Submit your own examples, diagrams, or lessons
  
- Fix a typo or translate a lesson
  
- Join discussions (Discord & GitHub soon!)
  
- Star ⭐ the [repo](https://github.com/hetfs/luaOrbiter) to support development
  

> Learn by building. Build by sharing.

---

## 📦 Bonus: Power Learners Only

Install [`luaDev`](https://github.com/hetfs/luaDev) for hands-on Lua builds and CMake-level control. You'll unlock:

- Cross-version Lua and LuaJIT compiling
  
- Project scaffolding for embedded Lua apps
  
- Logs, diagnostics, and Markdown reports
  

Advanced learners can explore Lua VM internals, DSL creation, and hybrid AI integrations using luaDev as a build engine.
