## 📖 What You’ll Learn

This course follows a **project-driven learning path**, progressing from basic syntax to high-performance and embedded Lua systems. You'll build real-world projects across:

- 🎮 Game development  
- 🔌 Embedded scripting  
- 🤖 AI automation  
- 🛠 Developer tooling  

Whether you're just starting out or looking to integrate Lua into your tech stack, this roadmap equips you with practical, production-ready skills.

## 🌟 Why Learn Lua in 2025?

### Fast. Lightweight. Everywhere.

- 🎮 **Game Development**: Lua powers AI, UI, and gameplay scripting in titles like Roblox, WoW, and Love2D.  
  → *Used in over 70% of commercial game engines.*

- ⚡ **Embedded & Edge AI**: Lua runs efficiently on constrained devices like microcontrollers and gateways.  
  → *Popular in Redis, NGINX, and OpenResty.*

- 🤖 **Hybrid AI Orchestration**: Lua bridges LLMs, C++, and Python in modern AI pipelines.

- 💼 **Career Boost**: In demand for **AI systems**, **embedded scripting**, and **game modding**.

## 🤖 Real-World AI Integration

### 🎮 Game AI Example (Roblox-style)

```lua
function enemy:update()
  local threat = aiPredictThreat(player)
  if threat > 0.7 then
    self:retreat()
  else
    self:attack()
  end
end
````

> Lua handles decision logic, while an ML model scores threat level.
