# 📘 Introduction to Lua

Welcome to luaOrbiter — your hands-on journey into the world of Lua!

This first lesson introduces you to the language, its purpose, and why it's such a big deal across gaming, embedded systems, and hybrid AI development.

## 🌍 What is Lua?

**Lua** (pronounced *LOO-ah*, meaning “moon” in Portuguese) is a lightweight, high-performance scripting language created in 1993 by a group of Brazilian computer scientists.

It was designed from the start to be:

- **Small**: The whole language fits in under 1MB
- **Fast**: Often faster than Python and even JavaScript in embedded scenarios
- **Flexible**: Can be embedded into other applications, engines, and systems
- **Powerful**: Provides dynamic typing, first-class functions, and metaprogramming

## 🚀 Where is Lua Used?

| Field                | Example Platforms                      |
|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 🎮 Game Development | Roblox, World of Warcraft, LÖVE2D       |
| 🌐 Web Servers      | NGINX/OpenResty, Kong API Gateway       |
| 🔌 Embedded Systems | IoT devices, firmware scripting         |
| 🤖 AI/ML Glue Code  | Hybrid AI control layers in C++/Python  |
| 🛠 Dev Tools        | Plugins for Neovim, Redis modules       |

> Lua is not trying to replace Python or C — it's built to **work alongside them**.

## 🧩 What Makes Lua Special?

✅ Simple syntax, beginner-friendly  
✅ First-class functions (like JavaScript)  
✅ Tables as flexible data containers  
✅ Extremely portable — runs anywhere  
✅ 1-based indexing (yes, that’s different from most languages!)

## 📜 Lua vs Other Languages

| Feature           | Lua         | Python       | JavaScript   |
|------------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| File Size        | ~250KB      | >25MB        | >1MB         |
| Embedded Use     | ✅ Excellent | ❌ Limited    | ⚠️ Browser only |
| Speed (native)   | Fast        | Slower       | Medium       |
| Syntax Learning  | Very Easy   | Easy         | Moderate     |
| Modding Use      | High        | Low          | Medium       |

---

## 🤔 Who Uses Lua?

- Game studios for AI scripts, modding, and behavior trees
- Cloud engineers for NGINX automation and API scripting
- IoT developers for fast, power-efficient logic on the edge
- Tool developers for customizing Neovim, Redis, and more

---

## 🧪 Your First Lua Line

Let’s write your very first Lua script:

```lua 
print("Hello, Lua world!")
```

Save this as hello.lua and run it using a Lua interpreter:

```bash 
lua hello.lua 
```

if you see Hello, lua world! you're goode to go!

✅ Lesson Recap

- I understand what Lua is and where it’s used
- I learned how Lua compares to Python and JavaScript
- I wrote and ran my first Lua script
- I marked this lesson complete in my [Progress Tracker](./02-beginner-checklist.md)
