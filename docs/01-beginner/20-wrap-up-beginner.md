# 🎉 Beginner Journey Complete!

You've made it through the beginner track of **LuaOrbiter** — congratulations! 🚀

Let’s review what you’ve learned and where to go next.

---

## 📚 Your Lua Toolkit So Far

By now, you’ve mastered the essentials:

✅ **Variables & Data Types**  
✅ **Control Flow (if/else, loops)**  
✅ **Functions & Scope**  
✅ **Tables (arrays & dictionaries)**  
✅ **Building Real Projects**  
✅ **Debugging and Thinking Logically**

You're no longer just reading Lua — you’re writing Lua!

---

## 🧠 What You Can Do Next

Here are a few ideas for where to go from here:

### 🕹️ Keep Building Projects

- Expand your **text adventure** into a full dungeon crawler
- Make a **todo list**, **chat bot**, or **quiz app**
- Build a **plugin system** for tools or games

### 📦 Learn Modules

Start structuring your code into reusable files using `require()`.

```lua
local player = require("player")
player.jump()
```

### ⚙️ Explore Tools & Ecosystems

* Use [Love2D](https://love2d.org) to build games 🎮
* Try scripting with [Neovim Lua](https://neovim.io) 💻
* Explore embedded Lua in [Redis](https://redis.io) or [OpenResty](https://openresty.org) 🌐
