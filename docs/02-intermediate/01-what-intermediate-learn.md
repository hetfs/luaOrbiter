# 🎯 What You’ll Learn at the Intermediate Level

The **intermediate level** of LuaOrbiter focuses on transforming your foundational Lua skills into robust, reusable, and scalable code. This is where Lua starts to feel like a real engineering tool.

By the end of this level, you’ll be able to:

---

## 🧱 Design Modular Systems

- Split large scripts into reusable modules
- Organize code for better readability and testing
- Build Lua libraries that plug into other projects

---

## 🧠 Master Object-Oriented Patterns

- Use **metatables** and `__index` to simulate objects
- Understand inheritance and class-like behavior
- Design flexible, extensible data structures

---

## 🚨 Handle Errors Like a Pro

- Use `pcall` and `xpcall` for safe execution
- Apply defensive coding practices
- Build robust apps that don’t crash on bad input

---

## 🔄 Use Coroutines for Async Flow

- Build **cooperative multitasking** flows
- Avoid blocking I/O with `coroutine.yield` and `resume`
- Model game state machines and simulations

---

## 🔌 Work with APIs and JSON

- Parse JSON using Lua libraries
- Interact with REST APIs
- Build CLI tools and web integrations in Lua

---

## 🛠 Intermediate Projects

You’ll create real projects that demonstrate everything you’ve learned:

✅ OOP-style character system  
✅ Plugin/module architecture  
✅ API client with state management  
✅ Dialogue engine using coroutines  
✅ Config manager with JSON support

## 🚀 Next Stop: Advanced Lua

After this level, you'll be ready to explore:

- C bindings & LuaJIT
- Performance tuning
- Debugging & profiling
- Building production-level Lua applications
