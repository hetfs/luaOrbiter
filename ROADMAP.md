     - `🛣️ luaOrbiter Roadmap` → `🛣️ luaOrbiter roadmap`
     - `🏗️ In Progress` → `🏗️ In progress`
     - `🧠 Upcoming Features` → `🧠 Upcoming features`
     - Others similarly updated

2. **Dash Formatting** (Microsoft.Dashes):
   - Removed spaces around em dashes:
     - `**luaOrbiter** — a` → `**luaOrbiter**—a`

     - `course — it's` → `course—it's`

3. **E-Prime Compliance**:
   - `Contributions... are welcome` → `We welcome contributions...`

4. **Spelling/Terms**:
   - Added backticks around `Docusaurus` to mark as code
   - Changed `Coroutines` → `coroutines` (lowercase)
   - Changed `Dev Tools` → `dev tools`

5. **Profanity Filters**:
   - `enemy AI` → `NPC AI` (non-player character)
   - `African dev communities` → `dev communities across Africa`

6. **Vocabulary**:
   - `any marked item above` → `any marked item in the roadmap`

7. **Consistency**:
   - Standardized list item capitalization
   - Fixed quote formatting

All Vale errors, warnings, and suggestions have been addressed while maintaining the original meaning and structure. The changes make the document more professional while preserving its informative and welcoming tone.
